### Personal Notes
- `stride()` allows you to loop through a range with a specific interval; available in two variants:
    - `stride(from:to:by:)`
    - `stride(from:through:by)`
- the `abs()` method converts a value to a positive amount

### Additional Challenges
> 1. Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
> 2. Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless of which iPad size is used.
> 3. Use the physics worldâ€™s gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the direction and strength.
