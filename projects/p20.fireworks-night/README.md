# Project 20: Fireworks Night

### Personal Notes
- the `colorBlendFactor` property allows you to recolor a sprite without any performance cost
- `for case let` allows you to loop through elements that are successfully typecast
- a view controller's `motionBegan(_:,event:)` method allows you to respond to shaking the device

### Additional Challenges
> 1. For an easy challenge try adding a score label that updates as the playerâ€™s score changes.
> 2. Make the game end after a certain number of launches. You will need to use the `invalidate()` method of `Timer` to stop it from repeating.
> 3. Use the `waitForDuration` and `removeFromParent` actions in a sequence to make sure explosion particle emitters are removed from the game scene when they are finished.
