### Personal Notes
- `UIActivityController` allows a user to share content with other apps across the operating system
- accessing and saving content to the device's photo library requires explicit permission from the user

### Additional Challenges
> 1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The `activityItems` parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. **Note:** Facebook wonâ€™t let you share text, but most other share options will.
> 2. Go back to [**project 1**](https://github.com/seventhaxis/hacking-with-ios/tree/master/projects/p01.storm-viewer/) and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.
> 3. Go back to [**project 2**](https://github.com/seventhaxis/hacking-with-ios/tree/master/projects/p02.guess-the-flag/) and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
