### Personal Notes
- the method `addObserver()` of `NotificationCenter` allows you to watch for a particular `Notification`
    - such as the keyboard changing frame and hiding content

### Additional Challenges
> 1. Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a `UIAlertController` – at the very least your list should include the example we used in this project.
> 2. You're already receiving the address of the site the user is on, so use `UserDefaults` to save the user's JavaScript for each site. You should convert the address to a `URL` object in order to use its host property.
> 3. For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a `UITableView`.
