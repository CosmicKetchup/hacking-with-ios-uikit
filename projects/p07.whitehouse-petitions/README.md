### Personal Notes
- using custom class initializer to display same `UITableViewController` in two different ways
- **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular, compact option for sending and receiving data
- `Codable` protocol parses JSON natively
    - consists of `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols

### Additional Challenges
> 1. Add a **Credits** button to the top-right corner using `UIBarButtonItem`. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the [**We The People API**](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers) of the Whitehouse.
> 2. Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a `UIAlertController` with a text field to let them enter that string.
> 3. Experiment with the HTML – this isn’t a HTML or CSS tutorial, but you can find lots of resources online to give you enough knowledge to tinker with the layout a little.
