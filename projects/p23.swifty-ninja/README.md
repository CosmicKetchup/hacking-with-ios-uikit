# Project 23: Swifty Ninja

### Personal Notes
- Swift collections have access to two methods which can remove a specified number of items at the beginning or end of the collection
    - `removeFirst(_ k: Int)` and `removeLast(_ k: Int)`

### Additional Challenges
> 1. Try removing the magic numbers in the `createEnemy()` method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.
> 2. Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
> 3. Add a _“Game Over”_ sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.
