# Project 28: Secret Swift

### Personal Notes
- the notification named `UIApplication.willResignActiveNotification` allows you to monitor if/when the app is closed or backgrounded

### Additional Challenges
> 1. Add a _Done_ button as a navigation bar item that causes the app to re-lock immediately rather than waiting for the user to quit. This should only be shown when the app is unlocked.
> 2. Create a password system for your app so that the **Touch ID**/**Face ID** fallback is more useful. You'll need to use an alert controller with a text field like we did in project 5, and I suggest you save the password in the keychain!
> 3. Go back to [**project 10**](https://github.com/seventhaxis/hacking-with-ios/tree/master/projects/p10.names-to-faces/) and add biometric authentication so the user’s pictures are shown only when they have unlocked the app. You’ll need to give some thought to how you can hide the pictures – perhaps leave the array empty until they are authenticated?
